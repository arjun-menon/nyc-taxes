NYC Tax Calculator
==================
This is a tool I wrote for personal use, to get a rough estimate of the taxes  
owed by an unmarried individual with no dependants living and working in New 
York City.

Usage
-----

### Command Line Interface

There's a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)-based command-line interface available:

    usage: node calc_nyc_taxes.js [-h] income [-d DEDUCTIONS] [-e EXEMPTIONS]

    Calculates total U.S. taxes owed by a single (unmarried) resident of NYC.

    positional arguments:
      income                Annual Gross Income

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d DEDUCTIONS, --deductions DEDUCTIONS
                            Itemized deduction other than the standard deduction,
                            personal exemptions, and state/local/foreign tax
                            deductions.
      -e EXEMPTIONS, --exemptions EXEMPTIONS
                            Number of personal exemptions. The default is 1.
